Base Repo til opgave om adaptive vs responsive CSS

Front-page (index.html) is responsive, and so is of course responsive.html.
The adaptive site has the same base-styling as the other ones,
but utilize media queries to style for specific breakpoints (screen sizes).
This is done by loading in the different stylesheet with new rules based upon screen size.
